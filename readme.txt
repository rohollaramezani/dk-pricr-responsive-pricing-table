A responsive and elegant way to present your offer to your visitors. Create a new pricing table now and copy-paste the shortcode anywhere.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a “Pricing Tables” tab in the admin panel which allows you to create pricing tables for your website the easy way. You can quickly add features to your different plans, choose a color (as well as many other options) and display your price table anywhere with a simple shortcode. What you see is what you get, and it’s totally free.
